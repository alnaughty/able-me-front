      <p class="md:text-[16px] lg:text-[18px]">We founded Able Me with a shared vision and a deep sense <br>
        of purpose—to empower individuals with disabilities to live life on <br>
        their own terms. Every journey begins with a belief in the power <br>
        of inclusivity and accessibility, and this belief is at the heart of everything we do. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        We understand firsthand the challenges that come with <br>
        navigating a world that isn't always designed with everyone in <br>
        mind. We've seen the barriers and felt the frustrations. That's <br>
        why we set out to create Able Me—a platform that goes beyond <br>
        transportation services. It's a lifeline, a community, and a <br>
        promise of independence.</p>
